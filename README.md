# Project Abydos Home

This page serves as the welcoming point for new folks to the Abydos project.  This project is currently under construction, but is actively working to put together Dakara, an Air Force EPR/OPR wordsmithing tool. _Note: Project Abydos is in no way affiliated with the United States Air Force.  Any opinions, ideas, or projects are those of the individual collaborators within the project and do not reflect those of the United States Air Force._

## Mission

Project Abydos' main mission is to find software solutions to common Air Force problems and develop them into functioning, joyful, open-source software products.  All code contributed to the project is licenced under the MIT License unless otherwise specified.

## Goals

In addition to the overall mission, Project Abydos has set forth the following goals:

- Build world-class software products that bring _joyful experiences_ to the users
- Create a home for one-off software solutions to now be _expanded_ as open source
- Solve _validated_ Air Force pain points based on our own active duty experience
- Establish a community of _innovation and learning_ for those interested in software

## Technology

We use a variety of technologies to build our software and always seek new technologies to improve the development workflow.  Some specific technologies we use include things such as Agnular 6, Bootrap 4, Cypress, TypeScript and more, but we largely strive to stay agnostic to individual tech stacks.  We also decided to build the project on top of GitHub to provide a collaboration platform that we can use to develop our products in the open so that others may learn from and contribute to them.
